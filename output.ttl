    sioc:content "What are Dominic Cummings’s reported allegations about Boris Johnson’s failings amid the Covid pandemic? Amid a furious row, the prime minister’s former chief aide is expected to accuse Johnson of allowing the death toll to rise in the pandemic, leaving the UK with one of the worse death rate among all major economies. Cummings is thought to blame the prime minister for blocking proposals to close Britain’s borders early last year and for delaying the introduction of a second England-wide lockdown in autumn. Cummings is due to give evidence to MPs as part of an inquiry into the UK’s Covid response on 26 May. What was the issue on border controls? Cummings is said to have supported plans put forward by the home secretary, Priti Patel, in March 2020 to reduce the risk of travellers bringing the virus to the UK by halting daily flights from Covid hotspots such as China, the US and Iran. At the time, many European countries were considered less risky because domestic lockdowns were in place. Between January and mid-March, travellers from designated high-risk countries such as China, Iran and Italy, but not Spain, were issued non-mandatory advice to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. That guidance was withdrawn on 13 March. Four days later, the EU announced it was banning nearly all travel from outside the bloc for at least a month. What was the advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)? Sage discussed the value of travel restrictions on 3 February 2020. They stated that halving imported infections would delay an epidemic in the UK by five days, while cutting them by 75% would push the epidemic back 10 days. The committee advised that “only a month of additional preparation time for the NHS would be meaningful” but that this would require “draconian and coordinated measures” that blocked at least 95% of imported cases – with knock-on effects for supply chains. The Home Office went back to Sage on 22 March, the day before the first national lockdown, and asked if the advice on borders should change given the coronavirus response had moved from containment to delay. The following day, Sage minutes reiterated the message that “closing borders would have negligible effect on spread”, adding that the number of cases arriving from other countries was estimated to be “insignificant” at about 0.5% of cases. Discussions around border restrictions continued throughout the lockdown and the Home Office went back to Sage on 28 April to see if the advice should be updated. In a letter to the committee, the Home Office noted that Sage had previously concluded there was “little scientific justification for implementing any measures at the border at that point”. In response, Sage advised that as cases fell in the UK, the proportion coming in from other countries might rise. Measures at the border could “change the level of risk” and these were reviewed. What do we know now? The UK had a poor understanding of the state of the outbreaks in European countries, and failed to detect tens of thousands of infected people who entered the country, largely from the continent. Of the 18.1 million people who arrived in the UK by air in the three months before lockdown, only 273 were quarantined. In May, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, revealed that in early March that year the UK had seen a “big influx” of thousands of infections that “seeded right the way across the country”. Genetic analysis of the imported cases showed that about a third came from Spain, another third from France, and about 14% from Italy. The percentage of cases from China was minimal, at about 0.1%. In August, a damning report from the home affairs select committee branded the government’s failure to impose border measures, such as mandatory self-isolation before the lockdown, “a serious mistake”. What about England’s second national lockdown? Following a leak, a number of newspapers reported on 30 October that Boris Johnson was to order a second lockdown in England after denying that another would be necessary and resisting calls for an earlier “circuit-breaker” as was introduced in Wales. Johnson did so the next day. What was the advice from Sage? Sage documents show that ministers were warned more than a month earlier, on 21 September, that the country faced “catastrophic consequences” unless they took urgent action and brought in a two-week circuit-breaker and other measures to stem the surge in cases. At the time, cases in England were doubling every week after an August of limited restrictions and the “eat out to help out” scheme which filled cafes and restaurants. What did the prime minister do? Instead of a circuit-breaker, Johnson brought in a tiers system for local lockdowns on 12 October. This imposed tough restrictions on places with the highest case numbers but allowed infections to rise everywhere else until those too came under the most stringent measures. Immediately after Johnson’s announcement of the tiers system, Sage released the September document in which it urged ministers to move fast. Between Sage calling for the circuit-breaker and the tiers system coming in, UK reported daily infections rose threefold to nearly 14,000, and were more than five times higher by the time the second lockdown came into action." ;

    sioc:content "A rise in the theft of catalytic converters from parked cars continued last year with the car insurer Admiral reporting a 44% jump in claims for the issue from its customers. Thieves have targeted car exhaust systems in recent years because some of the rare metals found in the catalytic converters are more valuable than gold and can be easily sold on. The owners of petrol hybrid cars are most likely to be victims, with thieves seeking out older low-mileage cars that are less likely to have catalytic converter locks fitted. Thieves will often pretend to be mechanics and use power tools to cut through exhaust pipes – often in broad daylight outside people’s homes and even in car supermarkets. Cars that have had their converter stolen cannot be legally driven. Admiral said there had been a 44% increase in claims for catalytic converters in 2020 compared with 2019, despite a dip during the first lockdown. The rise has continued into 2021, it said, and claims linked to thefts were 57% higher in March than in the same month last year. Lorna Connelly, Admiral’s head of claims, said: “The theft of catalytic converters is often carried out by opportunist thieves who may be working their way around different neighbourhoods. “This isn’t always the case, however, and there is evidence to suggest that criminal gangs are involved in these types of thefts.” Connelly said the profits from selling on the precious metals used in the converters could be used to fund bigger crimes, not just in the UK but also abroad. “Palladium seems to be of particular interest and criminals are aware of which of catalytic converters are more lucrative and contain more precious metals than others,” she said. Admiral’s data shows that the average cost of a claim for a stolen catalytic converter is now more than £1,500, depending on the amount of damage the thieves cause and the type of car targeted. Victims face significantly higher premiums as a result, and in many cases the car may be written off as a result of the theft. The insurer said the most targeted models are the Honda Jazz, Toyota Prius, Toyota Auris and Lexus RX. Hybrid cars are the most targeted because their catalytic converters contain a higher concentration of precious metals, and are generally less corroded. When Guardian Money highlighted the problem in February last year, rival insurer LV= reported a 600% increase in the number of catalytic converter theft claims between 2018 and 2019. Victims reported having two stolen in a matter of months, and some were told by their insurer that they would no longer offer cover. Owners of vulnerable cars have been advised to fit aftermarket catalytic converter locks, or ask garages to weld up bolts to make thefts more difficult. People without garages are advised to park their cars up against walls or fences to make access harder, and to avoid leaving the car with two wheels on the kerb which makes access much easier." ;

    sioc:content "The variant that threatens the British summer has already done far more damage in India. In October last year a sample from the western state of Maharashtra containing what would later be identified as the B.1.617.3 variant was sequenced and uploaded to Gisaid, a global database of Covid-19 samples from across the world. The variant had multiple mutations located on the virus’s spike protein that binds it to receptor cells in the human body. Some of these mutations were present in other variants, or seemed capable of evading immunity. All of this should have set off alarm bells in India and led to increased surveillance across the world. Instead, India’s genome sequencing project continued to flounder through the rest of 2020. For most of last year, India did virtually no genome sequencing, Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s leading virologists, told me. While other countries submitted thousands of sequences to databases such as Gisaid for scientists across the world to study, India submitted only a few hundred. This was partly due to a lack of funding. It was also possibly the result of a lack of interest; last year, India’s Covid curve appeared to be falling. At the end of 2020, the Indian government announced it was setting up the Indian Sars-CoV2 Genomics Consortium (Insacog) to increase genomic sequencing through a network of 10 laboratories. Its aim was to sequence 5% of all new detected cases. By Tuesday, India had submitted a little under 13,000 sequences – 0.05% of its total reported cases. Despite reporting about 400,000 new confirmed cases every day through the first half of May, India collected and submitted just 280 sequences over the last 30 days. Again, it’s worth putting these numbers in perspective: according to Gisaid data, India has submitted 2,247 sequences of the variant first identified there in October 2020; the UK, where cases of the B.1.617 variant were first detected in February 2021, has submitted 3,706 to date. Epidemiologists across India have suggested the variant is driving the country’s virulent Covid curve. This is also supported by data from Gisaid, which shows this variant has become dominant in badly hit states such as Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The World Health Organization has classified the strain as a “variant of concern” because of its potentially increased transmissibility. But the question of whether this variant is linked to more severe cases of Covid-19 is more complicated. Experiments on hamsters suggest that infections with this variant result in a greater loss of body weight, higher viral load in people’s lungs and pronounced lung lesions. The real-world evidence from India is harder to parse, in part because the sheer number of infections has overwhelmed India’s health systems, leading to countless deaths from a lack of simple life-saving measures, including oxygen supply. In the western Indian city of Pune during the early days of the second wave, when there weren’t shortages of beds and oxygen, there was no apparent increase in the death rate, the leading Indian immunologist Vineeta Bal told me. The question of whether this variant leads to more severe cases of Covid-19 is also closely related to vaccines. Over the last few weeks, at least three Indian states and two cities, including Pune, have shown signs of a vaccine effect – a decline in infections and deaths among elderly people, 40% of whom have now been vaccinated. Although some scientists and the WHO have suggested that antibodies acquired either from vaccines or from past infections might have reduced success in neutralising the new variant, the current consensus appears to be that the two vaccines being administered in India – the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the Bharat Biotech/Indian Council for Medical Research’s Covaxin – remain largely effective against the new variant as well. This new variant played a significant role in India’s overwhelming second wave. But the suffering was also caused by India’s costly mistakes. Religious and political mass gatherings such as a month-long election campaign and the Kumbh Mela festival went ahead. Such large gatherings resulted in increased social mixing and reduced adherence to distancing measures. The delays in genomic sequencing were potentially catastrophic, and not just for India. Meanwhile the country’s vaccination drive, which already seems to be having a positive effect on the number of Covid cases, has been impeded by a combination of shortages stemming from insufficient planning, and hesitancy stemming from poor communication. There are already signs this wave could be peaking in India. To prepare for the next public health crisis, the country must learn the lessons from its second wave. In particular, the government must stop hiding behind a veil of nationalism. On Tuesday, one of India’s most respected virologists, Shahid Jameel, resigned from his position as the chair of the scientific advisory group of the Insacog. Just days earlier, Jameel had written in the New York Times about the “stubborn resistance to evidence-based policymaking” that Indian scientists were facing, warning that “decision-making based on data is yet another casualty, as the pandemic in India has spun out of control”. In place of data, there has been patriotic bluster. In January, India’s health minister famously declared that India had contained the pandemic. By the middle of May he was being pilloried for responding to a sober Lancet editorial on India’s handling of the second wave by sharing a childishly written blog post complete with a cat photo. One would expect politicians and leaders to have shown empathy when the second wave hit. Some of this suffering could have been prevented: unfortunately, there’s little reason to be hopeful the government will reflect on this before the next wave hits.

    sioc:content "This blog is now closed. See all our coronavirus coverage Our full story on New York’s lottery incentive: New Yorkers could win up to $5m from the New York state lottery if they get vaccinated against Covid-19 at a state-run clinic, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday. The new incentive, called the “Vax &amp; Scratch”, will allow those who get vaccinated to receive a $20 lottery ticket for the $5m Mega Multiplier Lottery. Thirteen winners will get a monetary prize ranging from $20 to $5m. New York’s initiative is one of many incentives that have been recently launched across the US as officials search for new ways to boost the dwindling demand for Covid-19 vaccines: Brazil has detected its first six cases of the variant first detected in India, in crew members who arrived aboard a Hong Kong-flagged cargo ship, officials said on Thursday. Tests “identified the B.1.617.2 variant of the Covid-19 virus in samples taken from crew of the MV Shandong Da Zhi,” which arrived from South Africa, the health ministry for the northeastern state of Maranhao said in a statement. “In all, 15 crew members tested positive for Covid-19 and nine negative. Of the six samples with the highest viral load sent for genetic sequencing, all came back positive for B.1.617.2.” The 360-meter ore carrier is currently in quarantine, anchored off Brazil’s coast. Brazilian health officials have instructed the crew to isolate themselves in their cabins. But three with serious symptoms were taken ashore for treatment. Two have since returned to the ship, while one is in intensive care in the state capital, Sao Luis, the ministry said. “At this point, no local transmission of the Indian variant has been identified,” it said. All health professionals who have had direct or indirect contact with the patients are being tested and monitored, it added. “We are going to fully trace everyone, around 100 people in all,” state health secretary Carlos Lula told journalists. “Not everyone had contact with them, but we have to be sure.” Brazil is already struggling with one of the world’s deadliest outbreaks of Covid-19 - fueled in part, experts say, by the so-called Brazilian variant, which emerged around the Amazon rainforest city of Manaus in November and can re-infect people who have had the original strain of the virus. Like that lineage, the mutation first spotted in India has been dubbed a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization. Scientists say both may be more dangerous than the original strain. Since the Indian variant was first reported in October 2020, Covid-19 has battered India, which has now reported nearly 290,000 deaths and more than 25 million infections in all. The variant has been detected in more than 40 countries. Brazil has meanwhile recorded more than 440,000 Covid-19 deaths and 15 million infections. Only the United States has suffered more deaths and infections in the pandemic than the two countries. “You gotta get poked to win”, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday, unveiling a $5m lottery prize incentive for New Yorkers who get their first Covid-19 vaccination shots next week. The “Vax &amp; Scratch” program provides free state lottery scratch-off tickets to New Yorkers age 18 and older who get a first dose of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech shot or the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine from 24 to 28 May. “As vaccination rates slow across the state, we’re going to have to get creative to put even more shots in arms,” Cuomo said in a statement. “The more New Yorkers we get vaccinated, the faster we can return to a new normal.” Cuomo said 63% of adult New Yorkers and 51% of all New Yorkers have received at least one dose of vaccine, with 54% of adult New Yorkers and 43% of all New Yorkers now fully vaccinated. The scratch-off lottery tickets being used in the promotion normally sell for $20 and winners stand to take home anywhere from $20 to the grand prize of $5m. The ticket giveaway program is being offered at 10 mass vaccinations sites open for both walk-ins and appointments in regions across the state, including in New York City, Long Island, Mid-Hudson, Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley and Western New York. It was announced a week after Ohio governor Mike DeWine detailed his “Vax-a-Million” promotion that will give a $1 million prize each week for five weeks in a lottery for residents age 18 and older who have gotten at least one coronavirus inoculation. The first winner will be revealed on 26 May, and then winners will be announced each Wednesday until 23 June. A related lottery drawing is open to vaccinated Ohioans age 12 to 17, with five winners each landing a full four-year scholarship to an Ohio state university. With the total attendance cost for an in-state student at more than $24,000 each year, according to the university website, each four-year scholarship is worth more than $96,000. Ontario expects to permit outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people and allow non-essential retail to operate at 15% capacity starting the week of 14 June, contingent on certain vaccination rates being met, the premier announced on Thursday. Canada’s most populous province has been under lockdown since early April when a third wave of the coronavirus threatened to overwhelm hospital capacity. The reopening will be confirmed closer to the date, the premier Doug Ford said at a briefing in Toronto. The province will reopen outdoor amenities - including playgrounds, basketball courts and golf courses - as of Saturday. Covid-19 cases have been falling steadily in Ontario, and new modelling from the government released earlier on Thursday showed that if restrictions were maintained until mid-June, cases would likely remain under control. “We’re now in a position to look at a slow and measured reopening of the province,” Ford said. “This is being done slowly and with extreme caution.” Step one of a three-step reopening will also include outdoor dining with up to four people per table, a government release said. Entering step one will require 60% of eligible Ontario adults to have received at least one vaccine dose. Each step will last for at least 21 days, the release said. The plan is largely in step with what public health officials recommended when explaining the new case modelling. Ford’s government took heavy criticism from all sides for reopening too soon in March, which resulted in the punishing third wave and overwhelmed the province’s healthcare systems. “The direction of the pandemic has turned and if we’re careful and cautious, we can maintain this momentum,” Dr Steini Brown, co-chair of Ontario’s Covid-19 science advisory table, said at a briefing before Ford’s announcement. BioNTech’s chief executive Uğur Şahin said on Thursday the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with Pfizer Inc is expected to be 70% to 75% effective in protecting against infections caused by the coronavirus variant first detected in India, Reuters reports. “So far we’ve had the chance to test our vaccine against more than 30 variants of the virus. It has proven effective against mutations so far,” said Şahin in televised comments. Tests this week have focused on the India variant, he said. “We expect [our vaccine] to protect against infections by 70% to 75%,” he said after virtually attending the Turkish government’s science council meeting. Since the concerning variant, known as B.1.617.2, was first identified in India, it has ravaged that country and spread to at least 26 nations out of the 53 in the World Health Organization’s European Region, the WHO said. The WHO’s regional director said on Thursday vaccines being deployed in Europe, including the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, appear able to protect against circulating virus variants that have caused concern because they are more easily transmitted. A BioNTech spokeswoman said lab tests show that when the blood of vaccinated people is exposed to the Indian variant, 25% to 30% fewer antibodies were binding to the virus than would have been the case with the original coronavirus. That suggests protection against the variant, whether symptomatic or not, is a bit lower but still 70% to 75%. It is about 95% effective against the original version of the virus. Leaders of the world’s largest economies will adopt on Friday a declaration recommending voluntary actions to boost Covid-19 vaccine production, snubbing a push from the US and other nations on patent waivers, the final text shows. Several G20 leaders will speak at the summit, one of this year’s major events to coordinate global actions against the pandemic. The US president Joe Biden is not listed among the speakers, with vice-president Kamala Harris representing at the meeting, an EU Commission spokesman said. The White House did not immediately comment. The EU executive, which co-hosts the summit with the Italian government, is set to announce it will set up three manufacturing hubs in Africa this year to boost long-term production of vaccines, one EU official told Reuters. The official said drugmakers are also set to announce on Friday they will provide large supplies of at-cost Covid-19 vaccines to poor nations this year to try to redress a global imbalance. Among the drugmakers expected to announce doses for poorer nations are vaccine partners Pfizer and BioNTech , the official said, adding that at least two other companies are expected to make announcements on Friday. It is not clear whether the announcements will concern new doses or vaccines already pledged. BioNTech declined to comment and Pfizer was not immediately available to comment. The draft declaration, whose final version has been seen by Reuters, does not mention vaccine patent waivers as a tool to address the current shortages of jabs in poorer nations. The Biden administration earlier in May joined India, South Africa and many other developing countries in calling for a temporary waiver of patents for Covid-19 vaccines, in the hope that would boost production and allow for a more equitable distribution of shots across the world. EU nations and other vaccine-making countries have opposed the patent waiver and urged instead the removal of US trade barriers that they consider the main bottleneck preventing a ramping up of global vaccine production. The draft document recommends as short-term options to boost output “voluntary licensing agreements of intellectual property, voluntary technology and know-how transfers, and patent pooling on mutually-agreed terms.” It also says solutions should be found within existing global agreements that do not include patent waivers. Leaders are also set to recognize “the importance of addressing the ACT-A funding gap,” the text says, referring to the ACT-Accelerator, a tool of the World Health Organization (WHO) to distribute Covid-19 vaccines, drugs and tests across the world. An earlier version of the conclusions had a commitment to fully fund the program, which is still $19 billion short for achieving its goals. Leaders say that one option to quickly help poorer nations is sharing vaccines that wealthy countries have already purchased, but there are no firm commitments in the final text. The WHO co-led COVAX program, which is dedicated to equitable global vaccine distribution, is mentioned as one option for providing donated doses to countries. A spokeswoman for Gavi, a vaccine alliance that co-leads COVAX, said the best way to guarantee fair distribution of vaccines across the world is through “sharing doses with COVAX, along with ensuring a fully-funded” program. Good evening from London. I’m Lucy Campbell, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Here is a quick recap of all the main Covid updates from around the world: Northern Ireland’s devolved government has agreed to add Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar to its “Green list” for international travel, according to a letter to lawmakers seen by Reuters. The EU has reached a deal on Covid certificates designed to open up tourism across the bloc this summer, the centre-right European People’s Party said. Two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are around 85% to 90% effective against symptomatic disease, Public Health England analysis indicates. Canada announced it is renewing non-essential travel restrictions along the US border until 21 June. Japanese regulators recommended the approval of Covid vaccines developed by Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca PLC. Waiving intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines will not be enough to close the huge supply gap between rich and poor countries, the head of the World Trade Organization warned. South Korea has said it will conduct a clinical trial that mixes Covid vaccine doses developed by AstraZeneca Plc with those from Pfizer Inc and others Dogs are better at detecting Covid-19 in humans than many fast lateral flow tests, a French study found. Northern Ireland’s devolved government has agreed to add Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar to its “Green list” for international travel, according to a letter to lawmakers seen by Reuters. Those travelling to countries on the green list will have to take two Covid-19 tests- one before departure and one within two days of returning. Travellers from Portugal and Israel will also need a test on day eight after returning. The EU has reached a deal on Covid certificates designed to open up tourism across the 27-nation bloc this summer, the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) said. The certificate will take the form of a QR code on a smartphone or paper, letting authorities determine the status of a visitor based on records in their home EU country. It will show if a person had received a vaccine, had a recent negative test or had immunity based on recovery, Reuters reports. Lawmakers had wanted countries to commit to free testing for the certificate and said that no EU country should set additional quarantine requirements. Germany and Sweden were among those resisting, EU officials said, though EU countries in general are reluctant to give up their final say on border controls. In the end, EU countries agreed to refrain from imposing additional restrictions, such as testing or quarantines, unless considered necessary on public health grounds, the EPP said in a statement. Malta’s government has said it will spend a total of €50m euros ($61.12m) to issue vouchers worth €100 to every resident aged over 16 to kick-start consumer spending after pandemic, Reuters reports. Following a similar scheme on the island last summer, the economy minister, Silvio Schembri, said vouchers worth €60 would be available to spend in restaurants and tourist establishments, and €40 for shops and other services. Some 25,000 businesses are eligible to receive payment by vouchers. In France, the number of people in intensive care with coronavirus has fallen further by 93 to 3,769 people, while the overall number of Covid patients dropped by nearly 600 to 20,750. The number of new deaths from Covid in hospitals fell to 133, Reuters reports. Drugmakers are to announce on Friday they will provide large new supplies of at-cost Covid vaccines to poor nations this year to try and redress the global imbalance, a EU official familiar with the matter said. Coinciding with a global health summit hosted by Italy and the EU, the bloc will also announce it is setting up three manufacturing hubs in Africa from next year to boost long-term production of vaccines, Reuters reports. This has been shared by New York governor Andrew Cuomo: French prime minister, Jean Castex, said France would make Covid-19 vaccinations available to everyone over 18 from 31 May, two weeks earlier than the initially planned date of 15 June, Reuters reports. The government has recently relaxed conditions and age limits for getting the vaccine in order to stay on track to meet its vaccination targets. On Wednesday, France had already given more than 21 million people, or 32% of the total population and 41% of the adult population a first injection and and more than 9 million people have also received a second shot. The EU will announce that it will fund the setting up of three vaccine manufacturing hubs in Africa on Friday, Reuters reports. Reuters also reported an EU official as saying that drugmakers would announce on Friday plans to supply a large number of Covid-19 vaccines to poorer nations this year at cost or low cost. Italy reported 164 coronavirus-related deaths on Thursday against 149 the day before, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 5,741 from 5,506, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 124,810 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.18 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with COVID-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 10,383 on Thursday, down from 11,018 a day earlier. There were 69 new admissions to intensive care units, edging down from 70 on Wednesday. The total number of intensive care patients decreased to 1,544 from a previous 1,643. Some 251,037 tests for COVID-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 287,256, the health ministry said. India’s Bharat Biotech on Thursday said it would ramp up the production of its Covid-19 vaccine by an additional 200 million doses per year, Reuters reports. The additional doses of the vaccine, called Covaxin locally, would be manufactured at the company’s plant in Gujarat and would be available by the fourth quarter of 2021. The Italian government has approved a €40bn (£34bn) financial package to help businesses and households hit by the coronavirus restrictions as well as support young people in buying their first home. The prime minister, Mario Draghi, said the aid decree was slightly different from previous ones “because it looks to the future”. He told a press conference that the stimulus would help Italy’s economy to recover alongside the accelerated vaccination programme and as the coronavirus situation improves. “If the pandemic situation continues to improve, I hope there will no longer be a need for decrees like this later this year,” he added. About €17bn of the funds will go to companies or self-employed people, while a further €9bn will be allocated to provide credit lines for struggling businesses and €4bn will go to workers in sectors that have been worst hit by the pandemic. Another €3.34bn will be allocated to the tourism sector. Tax incentives will also be provided to businesses who do not fire workers once a ban on layoffs is lifted at the end of June. The package is expected to push Italy’s expected deficit to about 12% of GDP and public debt to 160% of GDP in 2021, said Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of the London-based research company, Teneo Holdings. Brazilian pharmaceutical company União Quimica has completed production of its first batch of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine using active ingredients and technology supplied by Russia, Reuters reports. The vaccine will be exported to neighbouring countries in South America, since Brazil has not yet approved the Russian shot for domestic use. Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, which developed the vaccine, said it had seen to quality control of the vaccine ingredients, which were put into vials and packaged for shipping – a process known as fill and finish – at the União Quimica plant in Guarulhos, just outside the city of São Paulo. Two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are around 85% to 90% effective against symptomatic disease, Reuters reports. Public Health England (PHE) analysis of data from the rollout of the shot suggested that the estimated effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, invented at the University of Oxford, was 89% compared to unvaccinated people. This compares with 90% for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. PHE is awaiting further data to publish its findings in a journal. PHE also said there was a “small reduction in vaccine effectiveness” from 10 weeks after the first dose of the Pfizer shot before the second shot was given. Britain extended the gap between doses to 12 weeks, though Pfizer warned there was a lack of evidence of its efficacy outside the three-week gap used in trials. Last week, Britain cut the gap between doses down to 8 weeks for the over 50s. Rachel Hall here taking over from Yohannes Lowe. Please do send over any thoughts, tips and ideas to rachel.hall@theguardian.com Canada has said it is renewing non-essential travel restrictions along the US border until 21 June. Non-essential travel restrictions have been in place between the two countries since 21 March. On Tuesday, Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau suggested that easing social curbs more generally would be dependent on vaccination rates and consistently low community transmission of the virus. This has been shared by Dave Chokshi, an American physician and public health official serving as health commissioner of New York City: Kazakhstan is rolling out an app which it hopes will limit the spread of Covid-19 by restricting people’s access to places such as bars, cinemas and airports based on their vaccination and infection risk status. The Ashyq (Open) app assigns each user a red, yellow, green or blue status based on whether they have been vaccinated, or been in contact with an infected person, Reuters reports. Users must scan a QR code with the app before entering a public place. The airport of the Central Asian nation’s biggest city, Almaty, will start using it from Friday after a few days of tests. The app is mandatory for cinemas and theatres and its deployment allows restaurants and bars to stay open until 2am instead of closing at 10pm. Those with red or yellow status, which is assigned to those currently infected with Covid-19 or who have been in contact with a positive case, will not be able to enter most areas. Blue status individuals are those with no sign of contact with a suspected case and they have almost full access to sites. Green status is temporarily assigned to those who have had a negative PCR test, or permanently assigned after vaccination. Almost 2 million of Kazakhstan’s 19 million population have received a first dose of the vaccine – mostly Russia-developed Sputnik V – and more than 800,000 have received both jabs. This has been shared by Edouard Mathieu, head of data at Our World in Data: Reuters reports: France will bring forward the date from which all people over 18 can get vaccinated against Covid-19 from the originally planned date of 15 June, a government source said on Thursday. The source said that French prime minister, Jean Castex, will announce the new date during a visit to a vaccination centre later on Thursday. The government has recently relaxed conditions and age limits for getting the vaccine in order to remain on track to meeting its vaccination targets. Nicaragua has approved Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light Covid vaccine, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), responsible for marketing Russian vaccines abroad, has said. Developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, the slimmed-down vaccine, which the RDIF said is 79.4% effective against Covid-19 and costs less than $10 a dose, has been earmarked for export. It has been billed as a way to help vaccine supplies go further in countries with high infection rates, Reuters notes. Japanese regulators recommended the approval of Covid vaccines developed by Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca PLC on Thursday, Reuters reports. The recommendations by a health ministry panel precede official approval by the government as early as Friday, said Japan’s health minister, Norihisa Tamura. Tamura likened the approval of the new vaccines to building extra railway tracks, telling reporters: “It means that the vaccination roll-out will be smoother.” Supplies of the Moderna doses have already been imported and are planned for use at mass vaccination centres in Tokyo and Osaka from next week. A district of northern Thailand has launched a raffle campaign for its vaccinated residents to win a live cow each week for the rest of the year, in an attempt to boost the local vaccination drive. From next month, one lucky vaccinated villager in the Mae Chaem district of Chiang Mai province will be randomly chosen every week to win a young cow worth about 10,000 baht ($318.78), Reuters reports. The campaign, set to run for 24 weeks, has been met with enthusiasm in the town of 43,000 since it was announced earlier this week. Reuters reports: India’s output of Covid-19 shots for August-December is likely to be lower than the government’s public estimate, according to internal projections shared with Reuters by two sources. Lower-than-expected production could delay India’s plans to vaccinate all its adults this year, amid fears the country will face another surge of coronavirus infections in the winter. India’s ongoing second wave, the world’s worst since the pandemic began, has overwhelmed its health system. The government last week publicly estimated 1.46bn doses of its three approved shots – AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Covaxin – would be made between August and December. Production of the AstraZeneca vaccine, of which the Serum Institute of India is the biggest maker in the world, is expected to reach 100-110m doses a month from July, and stay at that level for the foreseeable future, a source with knowledge of the matter said. That would be at least 200m doses less than the government’s public forecast of 750m AstraZeneca doses for the last five months of the year, a 27% shortfall. Almost 80,000 Olympic officials, journalists and support staff will descend on Tokyo in July, according to media reports in Japan, as organisers press ahead with plans to hold the Games despite overwhelming public opposition in the host country. An estimated 79,000 people will arrive from overseas to attend Tokyo 2020, the Kyodo news agency and Nikkei business newspaper said on Thursday, citing unnamed sources. That is about half the number expected before the coronavirus pandemic forced the Games’ postponement last year, and comes after organisers asked national Olympic committees and sports federations to reduce the size of their delegations. Justin McCurry, the Guardian’s Tokyo correspondent, has the full story here: According to Reuters, the EU health commissioner has said she is looking towards the summer with optimism, as vaccinations in the bloc gather pace. Following a video conference of EU health ministers, Stella Kyriakides told a news conference: Over 20 million vaccinations are taking place every week in the EU, compared to a few hundred thousand per week in January. “We can now look ahead with more confidence and also look towards the summer with cautious optimism,” she added, noting that 40% of the EU’s adult population had received at least one dose of vaccine, and 17% were fully vaccinated. Sweden registered 3,411 new Covid cases on Thursday, health agency statistics indicated, continuing a downward trend in new infections evident in recent weeks. The country of 10 million people registered 2 new deaths, taking the total to 14,351, Reuters reports. Waiving intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines will not be enough to close the huge supply gap between rich and poor countries, the head of the World Trade Organization has warned. South Africa and India have urged fellow WTO members to waive IP rights on vaccines to boost production, Reuters reports. Poorer countries that make up half the world’s population have received just 17% of doses, a situation the World Health Organization head has labelled “vaccine apartheid”. Last week, US President Joe Biden said he supported the waiver idea, but the EU was among opponents who said it will not increase output. Speaking to the European parliament on Thursday, WTO director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said it was clear that an IP waiver alone would not be enough. “To have solved the unacceptable problem of inequity of access to vaccines, we have to be holistic. It’s not one or the other,” she said, adding this could not drag out for years. South Korea has said it will conduct a clinical trial that mixes Covid vaccine doses developed by AstraZeneca Plc with those from Pfizer Inc and others, Reuters reports. It comes as a growing number of countries consider using different coronavirus vaccines for first and second doses amid supply delays and safety concerns that have slowed vaccination efforts. A health official said the trial would include about 500 military personnel who were vaccinated with a first dose of AstraZeneca’s shot. The study will examine T cells – immune cells that can destroy virus-infected cells – and neutralising antibodies in those who were given a combination of doses, the health official told reporters. Dogs are better at detecting Covid-19 in humans than many fast lateral flow tests (LFTs), according to a French study which could see canines more widely deployed for mass virus screening in crowded places including airports. The trial, conducted in March and April by France’s national veterinary school and the clinical research unit of Paris’s Necker-Cochin hospital, showed dogs were able to detect the presence of the virus with 97% accuracy. The dogs were also 91% correct in identifying negative samples, the study showed. A recent review of 64 studies found LFTs correctly identify on average 72% of people infected with the virus who have symptoms, and 58% who do not. “These results are scientific confirmation of dogs’ capacity to detect the olfactory signature of Covid-19,” the Paris hospital board said, adding that the study – which is due to be published in a scientific review – was the first of its kind. Jon Henley, the Guardian’s Europe correspondent, has the latest here: Reuters reports: India has ordered tighter surveillance of a rare fungal disease hitting Covid-19 patients, officials said on Thursday, piling pressure on hospitals struggling with the world’s highest number of daily infections of the novel coronavirus. Mucormycosis, or “black fungus”, usually infects people whose immune system has been compromised, causing blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing blood. Doctors believe that the use of steroids to treat severe Covid-19 could be causing the rash of cases because those drugs reduce immunity and push up sugar levels. The health secretary, Lav Agarwal, said in a letter to state governments that mucormycosis had emerged as a new challenge for Covid-19 patients on steroid therapy and those with pre-existing diabetes. “This fungal infection is leading to prolonged morbidity and mortality among Covid-19 patients,” he said in the letter reviewed by Reuters on Thursday. He gave no numbers of the mucormycosis cases nationwide but Maharashtra, one of the states worst hit in the second wave of coronavirus infections, has reported 1,500 cases. Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, has tested negative for Covid-19 after a worker at her residence tested positive, the presidential office has confirmed. “The president is healthy and safe,” it said. Taiwan is dealing with a spike in domestic Covid infections, Reuters notes. Pfizer Inc and its German partner, BioNTech SE, have said they will supply Turkey with 60m additional doses of their Covid vaccine as part of an agreement that includes the option for an extra 30m doses, Reuters reports. This latest pact follows a deal in December when the companies agreed to supply Turkey with 30m doses of the two-dose vaccine. Canada is poised to overtake the US in the proportion of population with one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, following early delays in its rollout. But Canada’s success in quickly vaccinating residents has raised questions over what more it can be doing as the pandemic persists in poorer nations. For months, Canada has trailed its neighbour in vaccination rates, prompting envy and frustration among residents. In March, the US was vaccinating at a rate three times that of Canada. Canada’s initial rollout was hampered by limited supply and confusion: in December, officials in Ontario, the country’s most populous province, apologised for shutting down vaccine clinics for the holidays. But with nearly 47% of its population covered by a single dose and new shipments arriving, the rollout has picked up speed. You can read the full story by my colleague Leyland Cecco here: Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until the evening (UK time). As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. WHO’s Europe chief has said that the currently authorised vaccines on the continent are effective against all known Covid-19 variants. But Hans Kluge warned: “Right now, in the face of a continued threat and new uncertainty, we need to continue to exercise caution, and rethink or avoid international travel,” Hans Kluge said, adding that “pockets of increasing transmission” on the continent could quickly spread. The European commission has said in a statement that it has signed a third contract with pharmaceutical companies BioNTech and Pfizer for an additional 1.8bn doses of Covid vaccine. The EU says the deal “will allow for the purchase of 900m doses of the current vaccine and of a vaccine adapted to variants, with the option to purchase an additional 900m doses”. Hungary has opted out. The latest data from India shows “a glimmer of hope”. The country recorded 276,110 new cases of Covid and 3,874 deaths in the previous 24 hours – those numbers are both dipping slightly. Data also shows the country’s daily recoveries have trumped the tally of daily cases for the seventh straight day. Taiwan has announced one new death and 286 new cases of Covid-19 today. China said it was providing Covid-19 vaccines to nearly 40 African countries. The vaccines were donated or sold at “favourable prices”, foreign ministry official, Wu Peng, told reporters. Singapore has ordered Facebook and Twitter to carry a correction notice to users of the social media platforms in the country over what it says is a false statement about a new virus variant originating in Singapore. Ukraine’s parliament has appointed Viktor Lyashko as the new health minister, urging him to speed up vaccinations against Covid-19. Britain’s Prince William has said he has received his first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. The International Olympic Committee has tried to reassure an anxious Japan that the Tokyo Olympics would be safe for athletes as well as the host community, amid mounting opposition to the Games and fears it will fuel a spike in Covid cases. Profits from Covid-19 jabs have helped at least nine people become billionaires, a campaign group said, calling for an end to pharmaceutical corporations’ “monopoly control” on vaccine technology. That’s your lot from me, Martin Belam. I’m off to do the Thursday quiz. Yohannes Lowe will be with you shortly to continue bringing you the latest coronavirus news from around the globe. Andrew Sparrow has our UK Covid live blog. Progress against the coronavirus pandemic remains “fragile” and international travel should be avoided, the World Health Organization’s Europe director warned on Thursday, but stressed that authorised vaccines do work against variants of concern. “Right now, in the face of a continued threat and new uncertainty, we need to continue to exercise caution, and rethink or avoid international travel,” Hans Kluge said, adding that “pockets of increasing transmission” on the continent could quickly spread. The so-called India variant, which may be more transmissible, has now been identified in at least 26 of the 53 countries in the WHO Europe region, Kluge said during his weekly press conference. But, AFP report, he said that authorised vaccines were effective against the new strain. “All Covid-19 virus variants that have emerged so far do respond to the available, approved vaccines,” Kluge said, adding that all Covid-19 variants can be controlled with the same public health and social measures used until now. So far only 23% of people in the region have received a vaccine dose, with just 11% having had both doses, Kluge said, as he warned citizens to continue to exercise caution. “Vaccines may be a light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot be blinded by that light,” he said. Uki Goñi reports for us from Buenos Aires: With both the Brazilian and UK variants circulating widely in Argentina, the patients now being seen by intensive care doctor Vanina Edul at the Fernández public hospital in Buenos Aires are dying faster, and younger: one recent victim was just 42 when he died. “I am seeing people die in less than a week – young patients unresponsive to treatment. You administer oxygen, do all the mechanics – turn them face down, face up – but it doesn’t work. Then there are other patients whose oxygenation level is not so bad – but they die anyway,” Edul says. A devastating second wave of Covid cases has caught Argentina off guard, with relaxed restrictions and a low vaccination rate. Cases have risen from a daily total of about 5,000 in early March to a record 35,000 this week, while deaths surged from 112 at the start of March to a record 744 on Tuesday. On Wednesday daily contagions set a new record, just under 40,000 cases, while deaths dropped to 494. The figures put the country third in daily cases after India and Brazil, and fourth in Covid deaths, after India, Brazil and the US. Relative to population, Argentina now has the highest number of Covid deaths in the world, with 16.46 Covid fatalities per million, far exceeding its giant neighbour Brazil, which saw 11.82 per million. Read more from Uki Goñi in Buenos Aires here: ‘People die in less than a week’: Covid wave catches Argentina off-guard We’ll have more on this in due course, but there’s a briefing this morning from the World Health Organization about the situation in Europe, and one of the top lines to emerge is the confirmation that the currently authorised vaccines on the continent are said to be effective against all known Covid-19 variants. Our community team are looking to speak to people in the UK and elsewhere who have been affected by the B.1.617.2 variant that originated in India. You can find the details on how to get in touch here: Regular readers will know that Russia regularly publishes almost exactly the same number of official new Covid cases each day – always within a range of around 7,000 to 9,000ish. It’s a little on the high side today, with Reuters quoting official figures saying there were 9,232 new cases, with 3,312 in the capital Moscow. The country also reported another 396 deaths, raising the official toll to 117,361. The federal statistics agency maintains separate figures, which put the nation’s death toll so far in excess of 250,000. The European Commission has said in a statement that it has signed a third contract with pharmaceutical companies BioNTech and Pfizer for an additional 1.8bn doses of Covid vaccine. The contract requires that the vaccine production is based in the EU and that essential components are sourced from the EU, Reuters reports. The EU says the deal “will allow for the purchase of 900m doses of the current vaccine and of a vaccine adapted to variants, with the option to purchase an additional 900m doses.” There’s a slight dig at the reliability of AstraZeneca as a supplier in the statement, which says: “Thanks to the well-established cooperation with the companies under the current contracts and arrangements put in place, timely deliveries of the doses are ensured.” The EU is currently in a legal dispute with AstraZeneca as the manufacturer has failed to deliver the promised number of doses so far. There’s also a nod to vaccine equity, with the statement saying: “The possibility for member states to resell or donate doses to countries in need outside the EU or through the Covax facility has been reinforced, contributing to a global and fair access to the vaccine across the world.” Avik Roy at the Hindustan Times says the latest data from India shows “a glimmer of hope”. India recorded 276,110 new cases of Covid and 3,874 deaths in the previous 24 hours. Those numbers are both dipping. But crucially, Roy notes: “The data released by the health ministry also shows the country’s daily recoveries have trumped the tally of daily cases for the seventh straight day.” Andrew Sparrow has launched our UK Covid live blog for the day – you can follow the latest UK developments with him. I’ll be continuing with the top global lines here. A quick Reuters snap here that Ukraine’s parliament has appointed Viktor Lyashko as the new health minister, urging him to speed up vaccinations against Covid-19. Lyashko was a deputy health minister and replaces Maksym Stepanov, who was fired this week after being accused of failing to supply adequate vaccine doses to fight the coronavirus pandemic. “Overcoming coronavirus disease is my number one priority. We will do everything so that Ukrainians can be vaccinated, work and travel,” Lyashko told the parliament. Setting up domestic manufacturing of vaccines would be a priority, he said. China said it is providing Covid-19 vaccines to nearly 40 African countries. The vaccines were donated or sold at “favourable prices”, foreign ministry official Wu Peng told reporters. Wu compared China’s outreach to the actions of “some countries that have said they have to wait for their own people to finish the vaccination before they could supply the vaccines to foreign countries”, in an apparent dig at the US. “We believe that it is, of course, necessary to ensure that the Chinese people get vaccinated as soon as possible, but for other countries in need, we also try our best to provide vaccine help,” said Wu, who is director of the ministry’s Africa department. Associated Press reports China has pledged roughly half a billion doses of its vaccines to more than 45 countries. Four of China’s many vaccine makers claim they are able to produce at least 2.6bn doses this year alone. Egypt will start locally producing China’s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine in June, with Sinovac enabling the Egyptian side to obtain the expertise and technical assistance to produce the vaccine, giving the licence to manufacture and pack the vaccine in Egypt. “Aid alone cannot solve Africa’s vaccine issues. We must support local manufacturing of vaccines in Africa, even though this is difficult due to [low] levels of industrialisation,” Wu said. Grant Shapps has been the UK minister doing the rounds on the media this morning – mostly talking about proposed rail reform, but with a healthy dose of questions about international travel. In his most recent appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Today he said he wanted to see more countries added to the “green list” for travel. He attempted to clarify the confusion spread by ministers earlier this week, saying: “The amber list and the red list are not for holidaymakers, that’s not the purpose of those lists at this time. “We just think that after a year of lockdowns in this country, of people coming forward in record numbers to get their vaccines, we do not want to be in a position of taking risks at this stage about our unlock.” Asked if he was pushing for the green list to be extended he said: “Of course. The reason for that is we have ended up getting way ahead in terms of our vaccination programme in this country and we are just having to wait for other countries to catch up with us. “That’s going to gradually happen, obviously, you can see it’s happening, so that list should expand.” Shapps said decisions on expanding the green list would depend on data showing the state of the pandemic in the various countries. “We are reviewing this all the time, every three weeks, the next review is in the first week of June and we’ll have to see what happens,” he said. “But by and large we are just asking people to be a little bit patient as other countries catch up with our world-leading vaccination programme and then people will be able to, I hope, travel.” The US, China and India have all administered more vaccinations than the UK. If you are confused about what the rules about face masks are in the US right now, you are not alone. Mike Stobbe, one of AP’s medical writers, has set it out this morning. He writes that “it depends”, mostly on whether or not you are vaccinated. If you’re fully vaccinated, the latest guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says you no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance in most situations. That includes when you’re outside and in many indoor spaces like restaurants, though you still need to follow any local or business rules. Americans also still need a mask when travelling, including on buses, subways and planes and at airports. The guidance on masks will differ by country. There are other exceptions. Masks are still needed in select settings including hospitals and nursing homes. And if you have a weakened immune system because of a health condition or medications, the agency says to talk to your doctor before shedding your mask, since vaccines generally don’t work as well in people with weak immune systems. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their last required shot. If you’re not yet fully vaccinated, the CDC still recommends masks in most places outside your home. That includes indoor public spaces, crowded outdoor events like concerts and small outdoor gatherings that include other unvaccinated people. Vaccinated people might also prefer to continue wearing their masks. Though chances are low, it’s still possible to get infected, even if symptoms are likely to be mild or nonexistent. Since children younger than 12 aren’t yet eligible for Covid-19 shots, they should continue to wear masks indoors outside the home and in most public places like other unvaccinated people. Some experts worry the CDC is relaxing its recommendations too soon. David Holtgrave, dean of the School of Public Health at University at Albany said: “A central mistake in public health is easing up infectious disease control efforts just before crossing the finish line.” EasyJet has said it can get almost its entire fleet in the air to take holidaymakers to “green list” destinations this summer, as the airline reported a £700m loss and 90% plunge in passenger numbers in the six months to the end of March. Johan Lundgren, easyJet’s chief executive, said: “With leisure travel taking off in the UK again earlier this week where we are the largest operator to green list countries … With so many European governments easing restrictions to open up travel again, we are ready to significantly ramp up our flying for the summer with a view to maximising the opportunities we see in Europe. “We have the ability to flex up quickly to operate 90% of our current fleet over the peak summer period to match demand. We know there is pent-up demand,” said Lundgren. “We saw this again when green list countries were released.” The budget airline said that based on current restrictions, it only expects to fly about 15% of its 2019 capacity between April and June, but said that there had been strong demand for more than 100,000 new seats made available to Portugal after the government’s announcement of green list countries earlier this month. Read more of Mark Sweney’s report: EasyJet is ready to fly travellers to green list countries using ‘90% of fleet’ Britain’s Prince William has said he has received his first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Reuters report that William, 38, who contracted Covid-19 last year, said he had received the shot on Tuesday. The Prince was at Saturday’s FA Cup final at Wembley in London which saw a limited number of fans able to attend as the UK government gradually allows the reopening of sports events to the public. Taiwan has announced one new death and 286 new local cases of Covid-19 today. The death was a woman in her 70s who worked in Wanhua - the centre of Taipei’s outbreak - and she died at home, the minister for health and welfare said. Her family have since been hospitalised. Of the new cases, 157 were in New Taipei City, and 87 in Taipei. The virus has spread to multiple counties and cities. 63 cases have not been sourced, while 84 are connected to travel history to Wanhua. There are also clusters at some Taiwan hospitals. Taiwan is currently battling its worst ever outbreak, having kept the virus at bay until now with one of the world’s best pandemic responses. Authorities are now rushing to contain the spread, which began among airline crews last month, and to update their knowledge of the new strains and science around transmission. The whole island is currently under alert level 3 of a four-tier system, and the government says it will not rise to 4 until there is 14 consecutive days of 10 cases or more, with 50% unsourced. Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung said more rapid testing stations were being set up at new hotspots, and the positivity rates at those already established in Wanhua were dropping, to below 5%. The minister has also urged journalists to take more care. Recent days have seen reporters out in hotspot zones interviewing people, or at press conferences wearing PPE but handling multiple microphones and not social distancing. Taiwan authorities are largely relying on community compliance rather than lockdowns. Schools are closed, as are public venues, and sport, entertainment and recreation venues. Private gatherings are capped at five indoors or 10 outdoors. But companies have only been urged to establish working from home, and cross-county travel remains allowed although discouraged. PA report that the UK’s transport secretary Grant Shapps has defended the continued availability of direct flights from countries such as India on the coronavirus “red list”. He told Sky News: “You cannot prevent British citizens from returning home, no country can ban its own citizens.” That’s not strictly true, of course, because Australia did. Shapps argued it was simpler to send people to quarantine hotels from a direct flight, saying that people on the flights were only British or Irish citizens, or those with permanent residence, and “it’s illegal come here as a holidaymaker from a red list country”. If there were no direct flights “you would be forcing a situation where people end up spread amongst many other flights and making it harder to carry out the mandatory hotel quarantine”. Shapps urged people to be patient and wait for the global coronavirus situation to improve if they wanted to go on holiday to countries which were currently on the “amber list”. Asked why holidays were still being sold to countries which are on that list, he said the Government had moved away from a system where things were “banned and illegal” to a situation where people were expected to “apply a bit of common sense”. He urged people to have “a little more patience as the world catches up with our vaccine programme”. The government in Wales has announced a £100 million investment aimed at reducing the record backlog plaguing the country’s health system and “kick-starting” the industry’s recovery from the pandemic. Health minister Eluned Morgan said the money will be spent on new equipment, staff, technology and finding new ways of working to help health boards improve services by increasing capacity and cutting waiting times. PA report Ms Morgan said: “Helping our health and social care services recover from the pandemic is going to take time, investment and a new approach to delivering care. “The remarkable commitment of our NHS and social care workers has helped us through this pandemic to a point where we can now start to think about the future. “I am determined that we now provide them the support they need to help the service recover.” Singapore has ordered Facebook and Twitter to carry a correction notice to users of the social media platforms in the country over what it says is a false statement about a new virus variant originating in Singapore. The ministry of health said it was aware of the statement circulating online on media outlets and social media platforms, which implied that a new, previously unknown variant of Covid-19 originated in Singapore and risked spreading to India from the city-state. Reuters report that the move came after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a Twitter post this week that a new form of the virus that was particularly harmful to children was present in Singapore, and urged for a ban on flights. Both the Singapore and Indian governments have criticised the opposition politician, saying his comments were not based on facts and were “irresponsible”. The UK’s shadow secretary of state for international trade Emily Thornberry writes for us this morning: Thousands are still dying every day around the world simply because we are not producing the volume of vaccines we need at the pace we need them to save those lives. And the longer Covid-19 runs rampant among unvaccinated populations, the more likely that aggressive new variants will emerge that threaten the success of existing vaccine programmes. That cycle needs urgently to be broken through coordinated action at a global level, but where is the leadership coming from to make that happen? Again, not from Johnson’s government. On one of the central issues, the proposed waiver of vaccine patents, British ministers have not just sat on the fence in the debate, but have kept entirely silent. What they should be saying, as Labour has, is that those talks must move quickly towards concrete proposals, but with the understanding that – on its own – a waiver of patents will not fix this crisis. In recent weeks, talking to NGOs, scientists and other experts in the field, Labour’s shadow cabinet has explored potential solutions to the fundamental global shortage of vaccine supplies. Today we have written to our counterparts in government outlining the key elements of a comprehensive 10-point plan to transform the volume of vaccine production worldwide. Read more here: Emily Thornberry – Britain could steer a global vaccination programme – but where is the leadership? The International Olympic Committee (IOC) reassured an anxious Japan on Wednesday that the Tokyo Olympics would be safe for athletes as well as the host community, amid mounting opposition to the Games and fears it will fuel a spike in Covid cases, Reuters reports. Speaking via videoconference that was broadcast alongside senior Japanese officials in Tokyo, IOC chief Thomas Bach said he believed more than 80% of residents of the Olympic Village would be vaccinated or booked for vaccination ahead of the Games set to start on 23 July. He rejected growing calls to cancel the global sporting showpiece, already delayed once due to the pandemic, saying that other sporting events had proved the Olympics could go ahead with strong precautions. Bach’s comments came as Japan kept up its battle on a fourth wave of infections, although a slow vaccination campaign has undermined already shaky public confidence that the Games should proceed. “Together with our Japanese partners and friends, I can only re-emphasise this full commitment of the IOC to organise safe Olympic and Paralympic games for everybody,” Bach said. “To accomplish this, we are now fully focused on the delivery of the Olympic Games.” Less than 30% of medics in Japan’s major cities have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, with just 65 days left to the start of the Olympics, the Nikkei newspaper said. Cabinet figures showed this week that three months into Japan’s vaccination push, less than 40% of its medical workers were fully inoculated. The problem is especially pronounced in the capital, Tokyo, which plays host to the Games, and other large population centres, where the rate of fully vaccinated medical workers was less than 30%, the Nikkei added. Profits from Covid-19 jabs have helped at least nine people become billionaires, a campaign group said Thursday, calling for an end to pharmaceutical corporations’ “monopoly control” on vaccine technology, AFP reports. “Between them, the nine new billionaires have a combined net wealth of $19.3 billion (15.8 billion euros), enough to fully vaccinate all people in low-income countries 1.3 times,” The People’s Vaccine Alliance said in a statement. The alliance, a network of organisations and activists campaigning for an end to property rights and patents for inoculations, said its figures were based on the Forbes Rich List data. “These billionaires are the human face of the huge profits many pharmaceutical corporations are making from the monopoly they hold on these vaccines,” said Anna Marriott from charity Oxfam, which is part of the alliance. In addition to the new mega-rich, eight existing billionaires have seen their combined wealth increase by $32.2 billion thanks to the vaccine rollout, the alliance said. Topping the list of new vaccine billionaires were the CEO of Moderna Stephane Bancel, and his BioNTech counterpart Ugur Sahin. Three other neobillionaires are co-founders of the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) reassured an anxious Japan on Wednesday that the Tokyo Olympics would be safe for athletes as well as the host community, amid mounting opposition to the Games and fears it will fuel a spike in Covid cases. Profits from Covid-19 jabs have helped at least nine people become billionaires, a campaign group said Thursday, calling for an end to pharmaceutical corporations’ “monopoly control” on vaccine technology. Here are the other key recent developments: EU ambassadors have backed plans to allow vaccinated holidaymakers to visit the bloc this summer. Thailand has begun vaccinating Buddhist monks against the coronavirus this week in hopes to build up their protection to allow them to perform their spiritual duties safely. Berlin joins the growing number of regions in Germany, slowly emerging from the restrictions put in place to break a third wave of the pandemic in March. Saudi Arabia has launched an online portal for airlines operating in the kingdom to register immunisation data for all foreigners travelling to the Gulf Arab state. Malawi destroyed nearly 17,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that had expired in mid-April, as the health minister blamed ‘propaganda’ for the reluctance of residents to receive the jab. The United States will donate a significant number of vaccines through the World Health Organisation COVAX scheme to distribute doses to poorer countries. The workers union representing cemetery, crematorium and funeral workers has threatened a national strike in Argentina if it does not reach a deal with the government on vaccines. Pfizer to begin vaccine production in Ireland after investing $40m in a vaccine centre that will create 75 jobs, the US drugmaker said in a statement. Iceland’s Eurovision entry, Dadi og Gagnamagnid, has pulled out of the live event this weekend after a group member tested positive for Covid-19. A year after the late Tanzanian president John Magufuli denied the existence of coronavirus in the country, the government will start reporting the disease’s prevalence. Egypt will extend coronavirus safety measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, including early closing hours for shops, until the end of May. The UK has launched a study exploring whether a third dose or “booster” shot of the coronavirus vaccine would be a safe and effective way of extending immune protection against Covid-19. Covid-19 infections have dropped significantly across the Americas, with the most dramatic improvement in the US due to mass vaccination. Thailand aims to administer one dose of a coronavirus vaccine to 70% of its population by September." ;

    sioc:content "Facebook has removed more than 110,000 pieces of Covid-related misinformation generated by Australian accounts in the first year of the pandemic, the company has revealed. In February, Facebook, along with Twitter, Google, Microsoft, Redbubble and TikTok, signed on to a new voluntary industry code aimed at combating misinformation and disinformation online. As part of the code, members are required to publish annual reports on how they are implementing the code’s obligations, with the first report due this month. In a blog post on Friday, Facebook’s head of public policy in Australia, Josh Machin, revealed that between March and December 2020, Facebook removed more than 14m pieces of misinformation related to Covid-19, including content about fake preventative measures or exaggerated cures. Machin said Facebook had identified 110,000 of those posts came from Australian accounts or pages. As part of the tech giant’s crackdown on misinformation, Facebook removed the former Liberal turned independent MP Craig Kelly’s Facebook page in April for repeated breaches, including posts about unproven treatments for Covid-19. The celebrity chef Pete Evans’ account was removed in late December for similar reasons. Machin also noted 6.2 million of the 2 billion people globally who had visited Facebook’s Covid-19 information centre, aimed at promoting authoritative sources, during the pandemic were located in Australia. Facebook has also made public a live list on Crowdtangle so people can follow the discussion of Covid-19 in Australia. The Crowdtangle tools have also been made more accessible to journalists and researchers for free. The federal government has said it could legislate a mandatory code later this year if the voluntary code wasn’t meeting expectations, but Machin said the code was “a credible, world-leading first step”, while noting misinformation was not limited to social media. “We need to understand online misinformation as part of a broad ecosystem of information-sharing. Misinformation can occur offline, online, on TV, on radio or podcasts, or in face-to-face conversations between family and friends. Often, sharing of misinformation may be inadvertent – but it can also be deliberately shared by political groups or bad actors,” he said. “Pushing back on misinformation is a constant task, part of the essential process of open debate in a democratic society.” Technology lobby group Reset Australia has been highly critical of the code, describing it as “limp” and “toothless”. This week, it published a report tracking 13 Australian Facebook anti-vaccination or anti-lockdown groups using Crowdtangle between January 2020 and March 2021. The organisation found the groups had grown in membership by 280% over that time with a total of 115,000 members. Guardian Australia understands Reset Australia’s report was finalised before Facebook implemented stricter rules around groups, and the company removed some groups for repeatedly sharing misinformation. One of the largest anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown groups featured in the report, Wake Up Australia, which boasted 21,500 members, has been removed by Facebook. Other groups or pages with the same name have appeared since. “We’re taking down groups that repeatedly share this content, removing related groups from the recommendations we show people, and directing people who search for Covid to credible information from leading health organisations,” a Facebook spokesperson said." ;

    sioc:content "Did he mislead the prime minister over care homes? In perhaps the most explosive allegation made during his seven hours of select committee evidence, Dominic Cummings said Hancock had assured Boris Johnson that all hospital patients heading back to care homes would be tested. He then said that, at a disputed meeting in May, the prime minister had demanded to know why this had not happened. Hancock has already denied these allegations and suggested that he only pledged to test all discharged hospital patients as soon as testing capacity allowed. Did he interfere with the testing programme to meet his own targets? Another key accusation from Cummings was that Hancock was telling officials to “down tools” on the test and trace system so that they could focus on meeting his target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April 2020. “It was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm,” said Cummings. Hancock has said that building capacity was critical to achieving the ability to test, among others, returning care-home residents. Was he too slow to react on PPE? Cummings said he was astounded to find that Hancock’s department had accepted that crucial personal protective equipment would take time to arrive because they were still shipping it from China, rather than making use of aircraft grounded as a result of the collapse in international travel. He also said Hancock had falsely claimed PPE funding was blocked by the Treasury. Did everyone who needed treatment get treatment? Hancock said publicly that everyone who needed treatment for Covid would receive the care that they needed. That this happened has been disputed, with Cummings stating that people were left to die “in horrific circumstances”. The Cummings claim is that Hancock knew that not everyone had received the care they required, because he had been briefed to this effect internally. Was Hancock complacent about having the right plan? It has become clear that when Covid first emerged, the government thought its plans to deal with a flu pandemic would form the basis of its response, but the disease proved to behave very differently. Cummings said Hancock gave reassurances that plans were in place, stating: “We’ve got full plans up to and including pandemic levels regularly prepared and refreshed, CMOs [chief medical officers] and epidemiologists, we’re stress testing now, it’s our top-tier risk register.” Hancock has called all Cummings’s claims of dishonesty unsubstantiated and untrue." ;

    sioc:content "Women’s average working hours in the UK have taken a far smaller hit during the pandemic than men’s, according to the Resolution Foundation. Defying predictions of a “shecession” at the start of the pandemic, the thinktank’s quarterly labour market report found that women were not as hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic as initially thought. Early evidence suggested that women – many of whom work in badly affected, low-paying sectors such as retail – were significantly more likely than men to lose their jobs. However, while the situation for working mothers has been difficult, a different picture has emerged for women as a whole over the past year. The employment rate among men has fallen by 2.4% since the start of the crisis, driven by a big drop in self-employment. This is a much sharper drop than the 0.8% decline for women. Full-time female employment has actually increased over the course of the crisis. And while working hours have fallen overall during the pandemic, the average woman without children was working more than her pre-crisis hours by the start of 2021, with an average increase of 5% since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. Overall, the fall in women’s total hours worked has been around a third smaller than the decline in men’s hours. The thinktank said this was partly because of women’s dominance in the public sector, including education and health, where they account for 70% of the workforce, and where employment has been relatively steady. It also reflects the continuation of pre-crisis trends, as women have worked longer hours to protect stagnant household incomes. However, the picture is different for working parents. Last July, when businesses began to reopen but schools remained closed, mothers’ working hours were down by almost a quarter (24%) on their pre-crisis level, a fall four times as large as that for fathers (down 6%) and almost twice as big as that of non-parents (down 13%). While the gap between mothers and fathers had largely closed by January, almost one in five (18%) of mothers said they had adjusted their working patterns to accommodate childcare or home schooling, compared with 13% of fathers. The UK jobs market is looking brighter, as retail and most of hospitality have opened up since mid-April. Payroll employment has risen for five consecutive months and vacancies are recovering, although they remain below pre-pandemic levels, according to official figures. Hannah Slaughter, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The overall impact of the crisis has been much more equal between the genders than expected. But with the crisis still with us, and the future of home working unclear, the lasting gender impact of the crisis is still highly uncertain.” The thinktank noted that fewer women than men say they want to return to the office full time – a change that could potentially damage their long-term career prospects if office presence continues to influence pay rises and promotions." ;

    sioc:content "When vaccines became increasingly available throughout America, US health officials moved quickly to try to convince large numbers of Americans to get vaccinated. But amid the mass vaccination rollout, Black and Latino communities, who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, have been left behind in vaccination efforts, creating racial disparities about who was more likely to get a Covid-19 shot. Amid federal and local efforts to address vaccine disparity, vaccination rates for Black Americans and Latinos lag behind the general population, leaving many communities of color still unprotected against the Covid-19 pandemic. Among the 57% of Americans for which ethnicity data was available who have had at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, the majority are white while only about 15% are Hispanic and 9% are Black: both lower rates than their proportion of the US population. Fewer than half of US states have vaccinated more than a third of their Black populations, according to data provided by Bloomberg, while more than 40 states have done at least as well with white and Asian people. While some states, like Mississippi, Georgia and Maryland, have seen large increases in vaccination rates among Black and Latino residents in the last week, most US states are still trailing behind on vaccinating communities of color. The reasons behind continued disparities in vaccine distribution are complex, ranging from a waning hesitancy towards getting vaccinated to disparities in public health infrastructure that disproportionately impact communities of color. Amid various explanations and some steady progress towards closing the vaccination equity gap, disparity stubbornly remains. “We have structural inequities in everything else, especially in healthcare. You don’t expect a thing like vaccinations to suddenly [make] that disappear,” said Dr Linda Rae Murray, a Chicago physician and former president of the American Public Health Association (APHA). In many states, early fumblings in the vaccination process have left lingering disparities in place. Missteps around providing accessible information on Covid-19 vaccines, combined with an ongoing level of distrust in institutions, has created vast amounts of misinformation on the vaccines’ efficacy and safety, resulting in some hesitancy, especially early in the vaccination rollout. “We still have people that still have not heard the information that they need to make an informed decision and we still have a range of misinformation out there and we still have some people that are purposely giving people the wrong information,” said Georges C Benjamin, executive director of the APHA. But vaccine hesitancy is only one reason for why many Black and Latino people remain unvaccinated. Polls from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that hesitation to get vaccinated among Black Americans has gone down in recent months while interest in getting vaccinated among Latinos remained high. In fact, white Republicans are more likely to definitively refuse a vaccination. Similarly, even though Black Americans have similar rates of vaccine hesitancy to white people, white people are more likely to get vaccinated. Beyond individual attitudes, structural inequalities are stifling equitable vaccine access. Transportation to and from vaccination sites has been an ongoing problem for many attempting to get vaccinated. Many low-income people of color don’t have access to a car or live near public transportation that could get them to vaccinations sites. Work and family obligations are another barrier that make it difficult for some to access the vaccine. Early on in the vaccination scramble, even if a person could navigate technological difficulties to secure a long-sought vaccine appointment, getting vaccinated often depended on a person’s availability during the day. For many frontline workers, the majority of whom are people of color, taking time off to get vaccinated is still not possible. Similarly, taking care of young children or elderly relatives can limit a person’s opportunity to go and get vaccinated. “All of these structural conditions … make it difficult to go out to these mass vaccination places,” said Murray. Some communities of color also struggle with a lack of health infrastructure, resulting in limited access to information on the vaccine or how to schedule vaccine doses. In many major US cities including Chicago, Memphis and Los Angeles, “pharmacy deserts”, a term used to describe a neighborhood with limited pharmacy access, disproportionately impact Black and Latino residents, cutting off access to vaccine appointments at commercial pharmacies. Similarly, as Black and Latino people are less likely to have insurance, they may have irregular contact with a physician who can provide greater information on how to get vaccinated. Some states and municipalities have taken targeted steps to make the vaccination process accessible. Benjamin noted proposals such as going door-to-door to create vaccine appointments, mobile vaccination clinics, and other attempts to create parity among vaccine distribution in many states. New federal initiatives to boost vaccination rates among minorities also include using Black-owned barber shops and hair salons as pop-up vaccination sites and to promote vaccinations as well as providing free Uber and Lyft rides to Covid-19 vaccination sites. “It is important to take the vaccine to the community and not have the community [have] to come to the vaccine,” said Benjamin. Benjamin also described how the federal government has plans in place to help achieve more equitable distribution. “We have states in the United States that historically do poorly on all health statistics. They’re at the bottom of our health outcomes for heart disease, cancer. They have high poverty rates. It’s going to take longer to get them,” said Benjamin. But as Murray noted, in the absence of any US national health system, states, even ones that historically had poor health outcomes concerning minorities or ones that are still struggling to accurately collect vaccine data on minorities, are tasked with closing the vaccine disparity gap. Plus, stopgap proposals to boost vaccination rates, especially with a looming 4 July deadline, are temporary solutions in the face of structural issues – like lack of pharmacies in a community – that create and exacerbate vaccine disparity. The use of emergency Covid-19 funding to fund short-term proposals versus sustainable investment in public health infrastructure generally leaves structural inequalities unaddressed in the long-term. “That’s like saying, ‘We’re going to hire a few more fire departments for the next year, but if you don’t have a fire department five years from now and there’s a fire, you’re still in trouble’,” said Murray. Ultimately, despite some gains in vaccine rates among communities of color, more work needs to be done – now and in the future – to adequately address health inequities pertaining to the vaccine and beyond. “There will be another [pandemic] and it won’t be 100 years from now. It will be sooner than that and if we don’t make these investments in our infrastructure now, if we don’t address the racial inequities that exist in our country … then the next pandemic will see the same kinds of inequities,” said Murray." ;

    sioc:content "The army rolled into Las Rozas at 0945 hours on Friday. A dozen personnel, including a colonel, a captain, a lieutenant, two sergeant majors and three corporals, arrived at Spain HQ early on a mission to vaccinate the national team against Covid-19, three days before their opening game at Euro 2020. In total, 43 injections were administered by staff from the Gómez Ulla military hospital, the few who already had the first Pfizer jab getting their second, while the rest got the single-dose Janssen. And then the players went back to their rooms, alone. Spain’s manager, Luis Enrique, insisted that the federation had asked more than a month ago for their players to be vaccinated, a formal written request landing at the ministry of health last week. “I would have liked it to have been done when it should have been done, after naming the squad,” he added. Now it had actually happened, the government calling the army in – because, in Jordi Alba’s words, they had “seen the wolf’s ears”, the danger right before them. It was their 12th day at Las Rozas, 25km north-west of Madrid, difficult days. “Not pleasant,” Luis Enrique admitted. Not ideal preparation for the Euros, either. There had been noise from the start, more than there needed to be. Sergio Ramos, the captain, had been left out of the squad after barely playing in 2021 and not a single Real Madrid player was called up. In their first warm-up game against Portugal, some supporters had whistled Luis Enrique and at full time chanted: “How bad you are!” at striker Álvaro Morata. But that was nothing compared with what was coming and by the time their second-warm up game arrived, they couldn’t even play it. Sergio Busquets had tested positive for Covid-19 after the Portugal game. “Everything falls down and you start to doubt,” Luis Enrique admitted. Spain activated the protocols. Taken home in an ambulance, Busquets went into quarantine for 10 days and Las Rozas was locked down, players isolated in their rooms, while the under-21s were called up to fulfil the fixture with Lithuania. That was easier said than done; most were on holiday. Like a Sunday league team, the federation began frantically ringing round, players hurriedly packing bags. They gathered together a team in “record time,” said Luis de la Fuente, the under-21s coach who had been called back from his home town of Haro. The squad was officially announced at 1.30am. Having travelled to Madrid and waited for PCR results, their first training session did not even start until 10.30pm the next day. On Tuesday evening, Spain’s European Championship squad sat and watched Spain play on television. The game, officially a senior international, will make a great pub quiz question one day: 16 players and the manager made full debuts, four debutants scored and two debutant keepers kept a clean sheet in an impressive 4-0 win. After the game, though, more bad news arrived: Leeds United defender Diego Llorente was confirmed as the second senior player to test positive for Covid-19. “Devastating,” he called it. The possibility of an outbreak was real, even the risk of Spain not making it to their first match against Sweden at La Cartuja in Seville. Busquets had been inside Spain’s bubble for six days, after all. The federation had already set in motion their contingency plan. On Monday, Celta Vigo’s Brais Méndez was called up, leaving his holiday in Mykonos to head to Madrid. Brais was not Busquets’ replacement, as initially assumed; instead, he turned out to be one of four players called up, alongside Pablo Fornals, Rodrigo, and Carlos Soler. Raúl Albiol was subsequently added to that group, and then so was Kepa Arizabalaga. After the Lithuania match, 11 players from the under‑21s joined them in a parallel squad, an entire national team working in a separate bubble and held in reserve in case needed. They had answered the call “in three minutes having been promised nothing”, Luis Enrique noted. The reserves trained at Las Rozas, but stayed in a hotel near Plaza de España. The original squad remained isolated and continued working, but not the way they had wanted it. Communal areas were removed, players ate in shifts and socially distanced. There were no video sessions: the last thing you could do was gather them together indoors, Luis Enrique said. Training was individual, focused on fitness. On Wednesday, group work was resumed but not in the normal way. The squad was split into two groups of 10 by position: in effect two teams in two bubbles, on the pitch and off it. If one fell, the idea ran, the other hopefully would not. As Luis Enrique explained: “[Left-backs] Jordi Alba and Gayá can’t come within 10 metres of each other. The right-back can’t mix with the right-back, the centre forwards, the goalkeepers. It’s two different XIs, a right-winger in each, a striker …” Three sessions ran daily, usually at 5.45pm, 6.45pm and 7.45pm, the hottest hours chosen to emulate likely conditions in Seville. Even within those groups, training remained incomplete with most of the work remaining individual, although some minor tactical preparation was done – throw-ins, restarts. In the open air, with all the gym equipment arranged under mini marquees, at least the coach could speak to players. “They’re not ideal conditions,” Luis Enrique said, “but there’s no excuse. We’re among the six or seven favourites for sure.” The restrictions remained. “We’re in that tunnel where we do what they tell us; we’ll do everything they say to make it to that first game,” Thiago Alcântara said. “We’re anxious to be a group again, in the literal sense.” Every day there were PCRs, the players woken early and tested at 8am to give the lab time to return results as soon as possible. Each test brought tension: “What if …?” Luis Enrique insisted: “There is that uncertainty and that affects you whether you like it or not. It creates unease. But that’s why we have Joaquín [Valdés, the psychologist] here and what we have seen in training is spectacular.” Good news followed: a full day of negative test results, then another, then another. The government agreed to administer the Pfizer vaccine but there were concerns about side-effects having left it so late and negotiations continued: eventually, it was agreed that the players would get a single-dose vaccine. Diego Llorente too tested negative, that initial result revealed as a false positive. There was relief, cautious optimism returning. Spain were at last getting there. They could start again, even if still without their captain Busquets. They would wait for him, Luis Enrique said. On Friday, after four negatives, Llorente returned to Las Rozas, handed a standing ovation as he walked back in. “I needed that,” he said. “We’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel a bit, and this will make us stronger.” On Saturday morning, the parallel squad were given a guard of honour, honourably discharged, their work here done no longer needed. And then, that afternoon the Spanish national team finally trained together – two days before their opening game. A small step that was a major triumph. Asked about their hopes of making it to the final at Wembley, Thiago had summed it up: “What we want now is to get to La Cartuja,” he said." ;

    sioc:content "Europe’s vaccination campaign is “unacceptably slow” and rising infection rates in most countries across the continent mean its coronavirus situation is “more worrying than we have seen in several months”, the World Health Organization has said. After France announced tougher restrictions nationwide and Italy extended its curbs until the end of the month, the WHO regional director, Hans Kluge, said on Thursday that new cases in Europe had surged from fewer than 1m a week to about 1.6m a week. “Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic,” Kluge said. “Not only do they work, they are highly effective in preventing infection.” However, he said, the slow pace of their rollout on the continent was “prolonging the pandemic”. Kluge said falling infections among the over-80s in Europe showed the impact of vaccination on the spread of the virus, while data from the UK’s campaign suggested vaccines had so far “saved, at the very least, over 6,000 lives among people over 70”. But he said that across the WHO’s Europe region, made up of 53 countries including Russia and several central Asian nations, only 10% of people had received one dose and 4% were fully vaccinated, while barely 60% of lower- and lower-middle-income countries in the region had started inoculating. “Let me be clear: we must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now,” Kluge said, urging all governments to share excess shots. The WHO said 27 European countries were in partial or full nationwide lockdown, and 21 had night-time curfews. “As long as vaccine coverage remains low, we need to apply the same public health and social measures as we have in the past,” Kluge said. “Now is not the time to relax.” Underlining the apparent lack of vaccine urgency in some countries, Spain’s Madrid region stopped administering shots at health centres for four days so medical staff could rest over Easter, despite pleas from the national government to continue. The health minister, Carolina Darias, said last week it was “very important” to keep vaccinating over the break to make up for earlier delays due to supply shortages, but Madrid authorities said more shots had been given earlier in the week to compensate. Spain’s 16 other regions were reported to be administering vaccines as normal. In Germany, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier became the first high-profile German official to receive a dose of the AstraZeneca jab as politicians joined an effort to shore up confidence in the troubled Anglo-Swedish vaccine. Steinmeier, 65, received his shot at Berlin’s military hospital under new guidelines restricting the vaccine’s use for the under-60s. “I trust the vaccines authorised in Germany,” he said. “Vaccinating is the decisive step out of the pandemic.” Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the guidelines on Tuesday after Germany’s vaccine regulator reported 31 cases of AstraZeneca recipients developing cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare blood-clotting disorder. The health minister Jens Spahn, 40, had appealed to politicians over 60 to show their faith in the shot. People under the age of 60 can still take it in consultation with their doctor and providing they have been made fully aware of the potential risks. Several other countries including France, Spain and Canada have also imposed age restrictions on the vaccine. The European Medicines Agency has said experts reviewing links with the rare reports of clotting have found no specific risk factors, but are continuing their investigation. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced an acceleration of France’s vaccination programme to make shots available to all over-50s by mid-May as he unveiled new Covid restrictions on Wednesday, stopping short of a strict lockdown. Schools will close for three weeks, non-essential shops will shut and people are restricted to travelling within 10km of their homes, with travel over the Easter weekend tolerated for those seeking to escape to second homes or rental properties but family gatherings discouraged. The prime minister, Jean Castex, on Thursday defended the measures, aimed at slowing the spread of the virus without shutting the country down entirely, as “consistent and pragmatic” after the opposition Les Républicains party described the country’s health situation as a “catastrophic stalemate”. Castex also said alcoholic drinks would be banned in parks and other outdoor public spaces, and police would be quick to disperse groups of more than six people, after French media broadcast images of carousing crowds on riverbanks and squares in cities including Paris and Lyon. Italy extended restrictions closing restaurants, shops and museums over Easter until the end of April, but added that “an easing of measures” could be announced if the trend of the pandemic and the country’s vaccination rollout warranted it. The decree, approved late on Wednesday by the prime minister Mario Draghi’s government, made vaccines compulsory for healthcare workers, with those refusing to be vaccinated liable to be reassigned away from the public or have pay suspended." ;
